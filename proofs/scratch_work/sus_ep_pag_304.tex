Define a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_k = 3a_{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} + 2$, for every integer $k \ge 3$

a) Find first 7 terms for every integer $\ge 1$

b) Prove that $a_n$ is even for every integer $\ge 1$

The solution:

a) $a_1 = 0$, $a_2 = 2$, $a_3 = 3*0 + 2 = 2$, $a_4 = 3 * 2 + 2 = 8$, $a_5 = 3*2 + 2 = 8$,
$a_6 = 3*2 + 2 = 8$, $a_7 = 3*2 + 2 = 8$

b) Scratch work

For the base step $P(1)$ we have $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 2$, so first two elements of sequence are even, next $a_3 = 2$, also is even

Next for the inductive step: suppose that $a_k = 3a_{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} + 2$ is even. We must show that $a_{k+1} = 3a_{\lfloor (k+1)/2 \rfloor} + 2$ is also even. In this sum we know that "2" is already even, we must prove that this number $3a_{\lfloor (k+1)/2 \rfloor} $ is even. Observe that the operation : $\lfloor (k+1)/2 \rfloor$ will get us on of the previous element of the sequence, let say it will be $b$. Observe that $b$ will be even, as defined above. $b$ can be represented as $2m$, so $b = 2m$. So we have $3a_{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} = 3*2*m$ obviously this number is even. $\blacksquare$
